## UX

The strategy was to create a simple, visually calming, and easy-to-navigate website that introduces beginners to yoga through a combination of informative text, images, and beginner-friendly videos.

The scope of features I wanted to include were:

An introductory article explaining what yoga is and how it is practiced (targeted at new practitioners).

Illustrative images of yoga poses embedded in the article to help users visually understand the practice.

Four beginner-oriented videos from different bloggers, each with a unique style and duration (10, 15, and 30 minutes), accompanied by short descriptions of the poses performed.

A clear navigation structure allowing visitors to easily find the introduction and video content on any device.

When designing the site structure, I decided to place the yoga introduction and pose images on the homepage so that visitors could get a complete overview in one place. The beginner videos were placed in a separate section to give users flexibility in choosing the type and length of their session.

The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that text remains easy to read and media elements display without distortion on all screen sizes. The color palette and typography were chosen to create a calm, focused browsing experience that reflects the relaxing nature of yoga practice.

### Colour Scheme

#F5F0E6 ‚Äî used for button text.
#5C3B1E ‚Äî used for website text.
#E6D3B3 ‚Äî used as the website background.
#B88B4A ‚Äî used as the background for buttons.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate my colour palette from the hero image.

### Hero Section & Call to Action
The hero section greets visitors with an inspiring quote from The Bhagavad Gita, placed prominently in large italic text to set the tone of the site. The text is aligned to the left within a wide column, ensuring readability while leaving space for the clean, minimalist layout. Below the quote, the call-to-action area invites users to choose their preferred yoga studio location. Three large, full-width buttons ‚Äî styled with a secondary color and responsive sizing ‚Äî direct visitors to city-specific pages for Berlin, Paris, and Dublin. On larger screens, these buttons align neatly in a row, while on smaller devices they stack vertically for optimal accessibility. The combination of an inspirational message and immediate navigation options creates both an emotional connection and a clear path forward for the user.
