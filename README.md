# 🧘 Yoga Website

This is a website for people who are just starting to get into yoga or are looking for a community in **Paris, Dublin, or Berlin** to practise yoga in a group. You can get more info about yoga in these cities or about the practice in general by asking the website. The website features an article about yoga practice for beginners, combining it with meditation, nutrition, general information about yoga classes, and yoga for pregnant women. Accordingly, the target audience is mostly women who would like to try it..

## UX

The strategy was to create a simple, visually calming, and easy-to-navigate website that introduces beginners to yoga through a combination of informative text, images, and beginner-friendly videos.

The scope of features I wanted to include were:

An introductory article explaining what yoga is and how it is practiced (targeted at new practitioners).

Illustrative images of yoga poses embedded in the article to help users visually understand the practice.

Four beginner-oriented videos from different bloggers, each with a unique style and duration (10, 15, and 30 minutes), accompanied by short descriptions of the poses performed.

A clear navigation structure allowing visitors to easily find the introduction and video content on any device.

When designing the site structure, I decided to place the yoga introduction and pose images on the homepage so that visitors could get a complete overview in one place. The beginner videos were placed in a separate section to give users flexibility in choosing the type and length of their session.

The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that text remains easy to read and media elements display without distortion on all screen sizes. The color palette and typography were chosen to create a calm, focused browsing experience that reflects the relaxing nature of yoga practice.

### Colour Scheme

#F5F0E6 — used for button text.
#5C3B1E — used for website text.
#E6D3B3 — used as the website background.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate my colour palette from the hero image.
